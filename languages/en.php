		Although the term martial art has become associated with the fighting arts of East Asia, it originally referred to the combat systems of Europe as early as the 1550s. The term is derived from Latin and means 'arts of Mars', the Roman god of war.[1] Some authors have argued that fighting arts or fighting systems would be more appropriate on the basis that many martial arts were never 'martial' in the sense of being used or created by professional warriors.[2]",

		"art-style" => "Arnis, also known as Kali or Eskrima, is the national sport and martial art of the Philippines.[2] The three are roughly interchangeable umbrella terms for the traditional martial arts of the Philippines ('Filipino Martial Arts', or FMA) that emphasize weapon-based fighting with sticks, knives, bladed weapons, and various improvised weapons as well as 'open hand' or techniques without weapons. It is also known as Estoque (Spanish for rapier), Estocada (Spanish for thrust or stab) and Garrote (Spanish for club). In Luzon it may go by the name of Arnis de Mano. The indigenous martial art that the Spanish encountered in 1610 was not yet called 'Eskrima' at that time. During those times, this martial art was known as Paccalicali-t to the Ibanags,[3] Didya (later changed to Kabaroan) to the Ilokanos, Sitbatan or Kalirongan to Pangasinenses, Sinawali ('to weave') to the Kapampangans, Calis or Pananandata ('use of weapons') to the Tagalogs, Pagaradman to the Ilonggos and Kaliradman to the Cebuanos. Kuntaw and Silat are separate martial arts that are also practiced in the Philippine Archipelago. There have been campaigns for arnis to be nominated in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists, along with other Philippine martial arts. As of 2018, UNESCO has inscribed 9 martial arts-related intangible heritage.",
